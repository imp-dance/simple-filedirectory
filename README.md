# simple-filedirectory
A simple solution without setup to get a console on your website with file uploading/downloading

## setup
To setup, simply download all the files and put them in an empty directory on your server (make sure you make the /files/ folder and put the background, or a custom one in with the same filename). List.php ignores the first file, just in case you want an .htaccess file in the folder, you can remove this code or just put an empty .htaccess in to avoid having any issues with this.
