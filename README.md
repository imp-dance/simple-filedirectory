# simple-filedirectory
A simple solution without setup to get a console on your website with file uploading/downloading

## setup
To setup, simply download all the files and put them in an empty directory on your server (make sure you make the /files/ folder and put the background, or a custom one in with the same filename). It should work just fine without any setup other than that.
